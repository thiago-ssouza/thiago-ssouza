## About me
<br/>
I have a bachelor degree in computer science from Catholic University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil. I am currently based in Canada, pursuing further learning as Information Technology Programmer Analyst at LaSalle College - Montreal.
I can to speak:

- French (Limited Work Proficiency)
- English (Full Work Proficiency)
- Spanish (Full Work Proficiency)
- Portuguese (Native and Full Work Proficiency)

I have two years of experience in Java for Web, coding in every part of the development Front-end and Back-end.
In Mexico, where I have lived 5 years, I worked as Proactive Monitoring Coordinator of LATAM. I have wored in English, Spanish and Portuguese. And also, I have learned so much how to communicate with people, understand differences, focus on the goals and be part of a team up to win.
I consider myself a self-starter, team player and proactive person. I am always looking for new challenges and ways to improve my skills. My passion is software development, which drives me to push myself outside of my comfort zone to acquire new knowledge and embrace new challenges.
